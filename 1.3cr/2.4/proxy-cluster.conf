#
# This is a sample Apache server configuration file for enabling automatic
# backend discovery and reverse proxy using JBoss mod_cluster.
# It contains the configuration directives to instruct the server how to
# advertise itself to a multicast address and proxy incoming requests to the
# discovered backend servers. For detailed information about these directives
# see <URL:http://docs.jboss.org/mod_cluster/1.3.0/html/native.config.html>
#
# Required modules: mod_proxy_cluster, mod_advertise, mod_manager,
#                   mod_cluster_slotmem, mod_proxy, mod_proxy_ajp
#

#   We have to listen to the port we advertise in order to be able to receive
#   clustering messages.
